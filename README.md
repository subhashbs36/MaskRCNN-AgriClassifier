# Paddy Field and Pomegranate Tree Classifier Using Mask-RCNN

This project applies **Mask-RCNN** to classify and segment paddy fields and Bushfarm pomegranate trees with high accuracy. It features a user-friendly interface built using **PyQt5**, making it easy to visualize classification results and interact with the system.

## Features

- **Mask-RCNN Classification**: Accurately classifies and segments paddy fields and pomegranate trees.
- **Elegant PyQt5 Interface**: Provides a sleek and interactive UI for real-time classification results.
- **Real-time Processing**: Quickly classifies input images for on-the-spot analysis.
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/paddy-pomegranate-classifier.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
    python main.py


## How it Works

1. Input Image: Load an image into the system.
2. Classification: Mask-RCNN processes the image, classifying the regions as either paddy fields or pomegranate trees.
3. Visualization: The PyQt5 interface displays the results, highlighting the identified areas.

## Future Improvements

1. Expand classification to other crop types.
2. Integrate real-time video processing.
3. Enhance the interface with more detailed feedback for each classification.
